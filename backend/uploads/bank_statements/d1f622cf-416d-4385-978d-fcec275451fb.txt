Here are four ways to protect yourself and the people you love against phone scams:
a) Don't pick up if you don't recognize the phone number. If it's really someone you know on the other end of the line, they'll leave a message
or send a text explaining the nature of their call.
b) Never give away personal information to someone you don't know. Even if they seem helpful or trustworthy or claim to be from a trusted
company or agency. Hang up if they request personal details from you.
c) Beware of grandchild impersonation. If anyone calls claiming to be your grandchild especially if they're asking you for money, a credit card
or a gift card to help with an emergency don't fall for it. Hang up and call your family directly.
d) Don't buy gift cards as a form of payment. A common phone scam is for a caller to buy gift cards in exchange for a cheque or other payment
of a higher amount. Legitimate companies will never ask you to settle a debt or pay a bill by purchasing gift cards.
